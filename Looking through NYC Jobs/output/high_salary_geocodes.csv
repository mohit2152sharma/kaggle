DEP protects public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous material pollution. The values DEP embraces in doing day-to-day work are safety, service, support, transparency, innovation, and sustainability. Every day DEP delivers 1 billion gallons of water to nine million New Yorkers and implements one of the largest construction programs in the region â€“ our capital program will spend $1.5 billion per year for the next ten years.

Our mission is to protect public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. Every day, DEP delivers more than 1 billion gallons of the highest quality drinking water to nine million New Yorkers, and treats more than 1.3 gallons of wastewater to protect the environment and the NYCâ€™s surrounding waterways. DEPâ€™s vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost-effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation.  The values we embrace in performing our day-to-day work are safety, service, support, transparency, innovation, diversity and sustainability.    We are seeking to fill the position of Deputy Commissioner (DC) of the Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO). This position oversees the maintenance and operation of DEPâ€™s extensive water, sewer and drainage systems, which deliver and collect water through 7,000 miles of water mains and 7,400 miles of sewers. The Bureau is often referred to as the â€œBillboardâ€ of DEP, because its 1,200 employees regularly interface with NYC citizens on streets and in communities throughout the five boroughs. Bureau staff respond 24 hours per day, 7 days a week to calls made to the Cityâ€™s 3-1-1 Call Center on issues related to water and sewer services. Response times and the quality of solutions are key measures in the Mayorâ€™s Monthly Management Report.   The Bureau is also responsible for maintaining more than 109,000 fire hydrants and 148,000 catch basins.  In addition, the Bureau contributes to improving storm water management in NYC through our Green Infrastructure Program by maintaining thousands of curbside rain gardens, referred to as bioswales. This responsibility requires the Bureau to manage the growth of green jobs, which are expected to provide employment and career opportunities to NYC citizens, especially in disadvantaged communities.   An important component of the BWSO DC position is providing leadership and policy direction to the bureauâ€™s staff of managers, engineers, construction laborers, and other operations personnel.

The selected candidate will be provided with a City vehicle to expedite his/her around-the-clock responses to emergency events.   Experience working effectively with labor organizations and represented employees will also be important to the success of the selected candidate.  Finally, as a member of DEPâ€™s Executive and Senior Staff team, reporting directly to the Commissioner of DEP, the ideal candidate must demonstrate extraordinary leadership ability and possess extensive experience in building partnerships within DEP and externally with other City agencies as well as with our water utility partners.

They will be responsible for performing multi-faceted assessments of the wastewater treatment processes at various facilities to continually advance Operational Excellence objectives. The Facility Managers for the treatments plants will use the Process Analystsâ€™ findings to optimize non-labor efficiency.  Some of the specific tasks of a Performance Analyst include establishing chemical selection and dosing criteria for nitrogen-removal processes, field testing polymers to select the most cost-effective products, reviewing unit-specific energy utilization to identify potential savings, evaluating new equipment in the marketplace, advising process-control engineers, reviewing engineering designs, and meeting with regulators regarding compliance matters. The majority of a typical workday will be spent at field locations.   The Performance Analyst will work with Operations staff in developing Standard Operating Procedures to implement approved initiatives. These analysts will frequently meet with OpX consultants to discuss vet suggested improvements. Performance Analysts periodically carry out experimental activities, independently or as a team, to determine if enhancements to various treatment processes are viable. Collaboration with the bureauâ€™s Process Development section to research and test innovative technologies is also required. The Performance Analyst may be asked to prepare and administer chemical and service contracts, and provide input to in-house engineering staff for equipment selection.   Periodically, a Performance Analyst may fill in for a process control engineer.

Only candidates under consideration will be contacted.  About the New York City Board of Correction The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Boardâ€™s five functions: â€¢	Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction; â€¢	Investigate serious incidents; â€¢	Review grievances from inmates and staff; â€¢	Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and, â€¢	Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.  The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules codifying ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the Cityâ€™s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the Cityâ€™s jails. Recently, BOC commenced rulemaking on restrictive housing and going forward, will update its Mental Health Minimum Standards.  Over the past two years, to expand its research, monitoring and rule-making efforts, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget to $ 3 million and its staff to 28 (with planned expansion to 36). With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and   external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.",For City employees: Go to Employee Self-Service (ESS) - www.nyc.gov/ess and search for Job ID #399528   Please submit a resume and cover letter.
